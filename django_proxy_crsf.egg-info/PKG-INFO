Description: Django HTTP Proxy 
        =================
        **Simple HTTP proxy service as a Django app.**
        django 代理服务，格式为 url('proxy/(?P<http>\d+)/(?P<url>.*)', proxy_view),  http为1时表示是http协议  0为https协议
        加入了crsf，避免跨域问题
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install with
        
        ```console
        $ pip install django-proxy-crsf
        ```
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        Forward as close to an exact copy of the request as possible along to a
        given url.  Respond with as close to an exact copy of the resulting
        response as possible.
        
        Includes a view function that can be used directly from a URL spec:
        
        ```python
        from proxy.views import proxy_view
        
        urlpatterns = patterns(
        	...
                        url('proxy/(?P<http>\d+)/(?P<url>.*)', proxy_view),
        	...
        )
        ```
